# React Fetch Data with CRUD App with Context & Reducer

This is a JSON Server based Blog App with CRUD via Fetch, Axios and jQuery Ajax. Eventually might extend to a headless WordPress

## Available Tech

useState, useContext, useReducer & useEffect hooks are used. Also Formik lib with Yup validation was used for Forms. I've created my own Form component Lib using Formik & Yup.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`
